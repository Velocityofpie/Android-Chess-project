OK, so to Save the files you would have to follow the direction like how Sesh's videos Video such as movies. Open Device File Explorer on the right side. Open up the data file and open up the next datafile then find com.example.chess62  make a new directory called "files" and next a new file call "matches.dat". Sorry about this but this was the only way to store the information and the only way taught to us. We Didn't Display the list but it does store all the moves.
